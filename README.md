A custom poimandres theme for insomnia

## About

This is a custom poimandres-ish theme for insomnia. I really like the vscode [poimandres](https://github.com/drcmda/poimandres-theme) and wanted a similar color scheme inside insomnia.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This theme is rough, and I chose a stopping point that was sufficient for the areas of insomnia I use daily. Feel free to fork and improve!
